# Board Service

The board service is a collection of backend services that support the
`argus-whiteboard`.  The `argus-whiteboard` is a whiteboarding application that
is being integrated into all spark clients including the Spark board.

The plugin-board SDK module includes complete access to the persistence
functionality of the board service including the encryption and decryption
strategies.  The board realtime service is a mercury channel, which is separate
for now, that provides realtime whiteboard activity updates.
